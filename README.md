# This is, BrahmelBot!

BrahmelBot is named after a character I play in an OSE D&D campaign with some friends. Of course, this is just a README, so if you want me to wax poetic about it, add me practically anywhere @ Ronexiaz and ask me there.

Brahmel Bot is VERY simple. Add him to your server and, as long as it's online, you can use any of the slash commands available.

As of July 5th, 2024, BrahmelBot can:
  - Craft random potions
  - Generate a list of random retainers
  - Roll stats based on the 3d6 system of OSE

Yeah. Seriously, that's it. If you have suggestions, drop them here or shoot me a message. Now, here's some license jargon to make this feel a little more legit.
